# 📈 Multi-Modal Stock Price Prediction and Trading Strategy

A hybrid deep learning system for 5-minute AAPL stock price prediction, integrating technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and market sentiment data.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds a hybrid deep learning model that predicts 5-minute closing prices for AAPL stock by integrating three data modalities:
- **Technical Analysis (TA)**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and other time-series indicators
- **Fundamental Analysis (FA)**: P/E ratio, EPS, and other quarterly data
- **Sentiment Analysis (SA)**: FinBERT-based financial news sentiment scoring

## 🏗 Core Architecture

**Input Features** (8 core features total):
- LSTM Sequential Input (5-dim): Lagged close price, volume, RSI, MACD line, Bollinger Band width
- MLP Tabular Input (3-dim): P/E ratio, EPS, aggregated sentiment score
